# Corporate Buzzword Corporate Buzzword
Looking for internships. 

When I wake up, I spend 48 hours reading HackerNews and playing Geoguessr. Finalist of 2025 SWE Lore Olympiad.

I can LOCK IN - after consuming copius amounts of latest Tech News, I spend half a day overoptimising my self hosted services.

**Imagine the result if instead of configs I am let loose on some meaningful work provided by YOU.**

I LOVE creating shareholder value - my dream job is optimising heuristic values to increase capital flow into your pockets.

I AM a team player - compsci student who actually is able to and enjoys talking to people? Unreal.

# Touching Grass
Most of my time outside of computering is spent in rowing boats.
Pictured on the left is Unemployed me, outside, in the sun, no computers around, unbothered, moisturised, happy, in my lane, focused, flourishing.
